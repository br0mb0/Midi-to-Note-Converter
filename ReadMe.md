# MIDI TO NOTE CONVERTER

This will turn your MIDI files into a string that contains only the notes of a certain track

## how to use

I think you need to have my module that i used so go ahead and

``pip install MIDIfile``

THEN to run it just go


``python main.py <FILE> <INTERVAL>``

ok so, the file parameter is just where u put ur midifile path
the interval part is how long the you have to wait between notes
before a linebreak is inserted. 

You'll be prompted to enter a track number, choose whatever looks right and if it doesnt work try another
